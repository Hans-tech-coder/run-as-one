# RunAsOne — Project Guide

**Read this file before touching the codebase.** It is the single briefing on what
this app is, how it is built, and the rules it holds itself to, so a fresh session
can start work without reading every file first. It is a map, not a substitute for
the code: the files it names carry the detailed reasoning in their own header
comments, and those comments are the authority when the two disagree.

**Keep it current.** Every feature, schema change, route, or convention that lands
must be reflected here in the same change — see [Keeping this file
updated](#keeping-this-file-updated) at the bottom.

---

## 1. What the product is

RunAsOne is a **running-event registration and results platform for the
Philippines**. Three groups use it:

| Who | What they do | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Runners** (public, no account) | Browse upcoming races, register solo or as a group, pay, and later look up their times and download an e-certificate | `/`, `/events`, `/events/[slug]`, `/results` |
| **Organizers** (the paying clients) | Create and manage their own events, see registrants, upload race results, run promo codes | `/admin/**` |
| **Super admin** (the platform owner) | Approve organizer accounts, set per-organizer commission, curate the shared running-club list, watch platform revenue | `/superadmin/**` |

Money flows to the organizer through PayMongo or a direct bank transfer; the
platform takes a per-runner admin fee.

---

## 2. Stack and hard constraints

- **Next.js 16.2 (App Router) + React 19**, TypeScript, deployed on **Vercel**.
- **This is NOT the Next.js in your training data.** Breaking API and convention
  changes. **Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before
  writing Next-specific code.** Two changes that bite immediately:
  - Route params are **async**: `{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }`,
    then `const { id } = await params;`.
  - `middleware.ts` is now **`src/proxy.ts`**, default-exporting `proxy()`.
- **Prisma 7 + `@prisma/adapter-pg`** against **Neon Postgres**.
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (`@import "tailwindcss"` + `@theme`) alongside hand-written
  CSS files and CSS custom properties in `src/app/globals.css`.
- **Vercel Blob** for every uploaded file. There is **no local filesystem
  fallback** — Vercel's disk is read-only, so `writeFile` is never an option.
- Other notable deps: `jose` (JWT), `bcryptjs`, `pdf-lib` (e-certificates),
  `xlsx` (results import / registrant export), `@tanstack/react-table`,
  `framer-motion`, `gsap`, `lucide-react`.
- **Hosting budget matters.** Vercel + Neon's free 0.5 GB Postgres tier. Weigh
  storage cost before proposing schema growth, and say so when you do.

### Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # dev server on :3000 (use the Browser pane / launch.json, never a raw shell server)
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run seed:dev   # scripts/seed-dev.ts
npm run uppercase:existing  # brings pre-uppercase-rule rows into line; --write to apply
npm run test:blob  # scripts/test-blob.ts — exercises both blob stores
```

`npx prisma migrate dev` / `npx prisma generate` for schema work. Migrations run
DDL through `DIRECT_URL` (see `prisma.config.ts`); the app itself uses the pooled
`DATABASE_URL` (see `src/lib/db.ts`).

### Environment (`.env`, mirrored in `.env.example`)

| Var | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Neon **pooled** connection, used at runtime |
| `DIRECT_URL` | Neon **direct** connection, used by Prisma Migrate (DDL cannot cross PgBouncer) |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Signs the admin session cookie. The app refuses to boot without it |
| `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` | **Public** blob store: event banners, race-kit posters, certificate templates |
| `PROOFS_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` | **Private** blob store: payment receipts |
| `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY`, `PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | PayMongo |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend — sends registration confirmation emails from `info@cresendorunningcommunity.com`. Unset in dev just skips the send (see `lib/email.ts`) |

Two blob stores, not one: a store's access level is fixed at creation, so a
single store cannot hold both public and private blobs.

## 4. Data model (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

The schema's own doc comments explain *why* each column exists — read them. The
shape:

- **Organizer** — the client account. `role` is `ORGANIZER` or `SUPER_ADMIN`;
  `status` is `PENDING`/approved; `adminFee` is the per-runner commission in
  centavos. Owns `Event[]` and `PromoCode[]`.
- **Event** — title, unique **`slug`**, `date` (**string `YYYY-MM-DD`**, not
  DateTime), location, imagery, logistics fees, `adminFee`, `shirtSizeUpcharge`,
  `consentWaiver` (string[] of paragraphs), `registrationForm`
  (`ONLINE` | `BANK_TRANSFER`), `eventType` (`RACE` | `FUN_RUN`), certificate
  template + coordinates. Owns `Category[]`, `BankAccount[]`, `Registration[]`,
  `RaceResult[]`.
- **Category** — what a runner buys. A `RACE` event's categories carry a
  `distance` (`"10K"`); a `FUN_RUN`'s carry a package `imageUrl` and no distance.
  `inclusions` is a string[]. `price` in centavos.
- **BankAccount** — per event, not per organizer: bank/account name, number kept
  exactly as typed, optional QR image, `sortOrder`.
- **Registration** — one order. `orderRef` unique; all amounts centavos
  (`subtotal`, `deliveryFee`, `platformFee`, `transactionFee`, `totalAmount`);
  `status` (`PAID`, `PENDING`…), `paymentMethod`, `proofOfPayment` (private blob
  **pathname**, not URL), `transactionNumber`, `consentGiven` + `consentGivenAt`.
  Owns `Runner[]`.
- **Runner** — one participant on an order: name, contact, gender, birthdate,
  `singletSize`, emergency contact, medical notes, `runningCommunity` (free-text
  snapshot, defaults to `"INDEPENDENT RUNNER"`).
- **RunningCommunity** — the shared master club list. `slug` is the uppercased
  name and carries uniqueness; `status` is `PENDING` (a runner's write-in) or
  `APPROVED` (appears in pickers). Rejecting deletes the row.
- **PromoCode** — per organizer. `discountType` `FIXED` (centavos) or
  `PERCENTAGE` (**basis points**, 1000 = 10%).
- **RaceResult** — one finisher: bib (unique per event), name, gender, chip/gun
  time, `chipTimeSecs`, and the three ranks (overall, gender, category).

## 5. Domain rules that live in `src/lib` — read before re-inventing

These modules exist so two screens can never disagree about the same rule. If a
task touches one of these subjects, import from here rather than writing the
logic again.

| Module | The rule it owns |
| --- | --- |
| `money.ts` | **All money is integer centavos.** Convert pesos→centavos when data *enters*, centavos→pesos only when *displayed*, never in between. `toCentavos`, `toPesos`, `formatPesos` (no ₱ symbol; add it at the call site). |
| `event-schedule.ts` | The line between upcoming and finished. "Today" is **Asia/Manila**, not the server's UTC. A race stays upcoming through race day itself. `upcomingEvents()`/`finishedEvents()` return Prisma `where`s; `soonestFirst`/`mostRecentFirst` the orderings; `hasFinished()` the per-event check; `formatEventDay(Short)` and `formatEventTime` for display. `isCalendarDay` guards the `YYYY-MM-DD` format at the API door. |
| `event-slug.ts` | Public event URLs. `slugifyEventTitle` → `uniqueEventSlug` on write; `eventByParam` matches slug **or** legacy cuid on read, and `canonicalEventPath` redirects old cuid links to the slug. |
| `event-type.ts` | `RACE` vs `FUN_RUN`. `asEventType` guards untrusted input (defaults to `RACE`); `sellsPackages(event)` is the branch the forms and wizards use. |
| `registration-form.ts` | `ONLINE` vs `BANK_TRANSFER` checkout. `asRegistrationForm` defaults to `ONLINE`; `offersBankTransfer`. |
| `shirt-size.ts` | The size chart, whether a category needs a size at all, and the 4XL-and-up upcharge. `subtotalWithUpcharge` is the priced truth. `shouldAskShirtSize(categories, categoryId)` decides whether the wizards show the field and whether validation requires it: the chosen category decides once one is picked, and before then the field is already visible when **every** option the event sells includes something to wear. It hides up front only for an event that also sells an option with nothing to wear (the Tarlac band-only package), where the answer is genuinely undecided. |
| `app/events/[slug]/register/delivery.ts` | Race-kit delivery tiers — the **money** only. A fee of `0` means **not offered**. `deliveryTiers`, `deliveryFeeFor`. Shared by both wizards so they can never charge differently. The zone codes, their guard and their labels moved to `registration-codes.ts`; this module re-exports them. |
| `app/events/[slug]/register/validation.ts` | What step 1 requires. Returns *which* fields are wrong, driving the red states, the summary dialog, and where the caret lands. Missing answers are most of it; a phone number that is present but the wrong length for its country is the exception, and it is named as such ("Mobile number must be 10 digits") rather than reported as blank. |
| `consent-waiver.ts` | The liability/media/data-privacy waiver. Organizers may override it per event; the default wording is supplied here. **Never present an empty waiver.** |
| `running-community.ts` + `running-community-store.ts` | Club names, `INDEPENDENT RUNNER`, and the pending/approved flow for runner write-ins. `asRunnerCommunity` is what a runner's club is stored as: normalized, then **uppercased** like every other registrant field (see `text-case.ts`), with a blank answer landing on `INDEPENDENT RUNNER`. The picker snaps a typed club to an approved entry's own casing *before* that, so matching is still on the list's terms. |
| `inclusions.ts` | Free text (one item per line) ⇄ stored string[] for what a category includes. |
| `text-case.ts` | **Registrant text is stored UPPERCASE** — first and last name, gender, emergency contact name, delivery address, medical conditions, running community. The stored value, not a CSS transform: the same runner is read back by the admin table, the runner modal, the CSV export, both emails and the e-certificate, and a `text-transform` fixes exactly one of those. `upperCaseAsTyped` runs in both wizards and the admin's runner-edit modal (it does not trim, or a space between two given names would vanish as it is typed); `upperCaseForStorage` / `optionalUpperCaseForStorage` run in both checkout routes and the runner PUT, because a tab left open can POST past the UI. **Email is never uppercased** — the local part is case-sensitive on some mail servers — and neither are passwords, phone numbers, blob URLs, or most of what an organizer types about their own event. The **category / package name is the exception** and *is* uppercased (in `EventOptionsPanel` as it is typed, and in both admin event routes on the write): it is printed beside runner data in the registrants table, the export and the emails, so it has to match them. A closed picker carries the casing in its own options (`GenderField` offers `MALE`/`FEMALE`), and a **sample** placeholder is uppercase too — `JUAN`, `DELA CRUZ` — so the hint matches what will appear in the box. A placeholder that *describes the shape of the answer* counts as a sample and is uppercased too — the delivery address reads "HOUSE/UNIT NO., STREET, BARANGAY, CITY/MUNICIPALITY, PROVINCE, ZIP CODE". Only a placeholder that tells the runner what to **do** stays in sentence case: "Select Gender", "Select or type a size", the club picker's "Type to search, or add your own", and the email address. Where such an instruction **quotes a sample**, that quoted part alone is uppercased — medical conditions reads "e.g. ASTHMA, ALLERGIES (Leave blank if none)". |
| `registration-codes.ts` | The three coded columns on a `Registration` — `paymentMethod`, `logisticsMethod`, `deliveryZone` — and the words a person reads instead. They are stored **UPPERCASE** (`BANK_TRANSFER`, `DELIVERY`, `INSIDE`) like every other coded column in the schema; they used to be the only lowercase ones, because they were kept in PayMongo's casing. `asLogisticsMethod` / `asDeliveryZone` / `asPaymentMethod` **accept either casing**, so a registration written before the change still prices and displays correctly and no backfill is needed. `paymongoPaymentType()` is the **only** place a method is lowercased, at the PayMongo API boundary in `api/checkout` — their API rejects anything else. The labels are title case for a runner choosing or reading a receipt; `registrants/page.tsx` uppercases them once for the admin, where they are stored data beside a runner's uppercase name. `delivery.ts` re-exports the zone type and guard from here and keeps only the money. |
| `inclusion-icon.ts` | Which icon stands for a line of "What's Included". Keyword → icon, whole-word matched with an optional plural, first rule wins, and a plain `Check` for anything unrecognised — a wrong icon misinforms, a check merely fails to inform. It lives here so the same inclusion never draws a different icon on a different screen. The vocabulary is the organizer's: a **bib** is the chequered race flag, the **ticket** belongs to a *raffle*, a **band** or wristband is `Watch`, a **pin** or badge is `Badge`, an **entitlement** is `Gift`, a **bandana** or scarf is the bandana icon — plus `Shirt`, `Medal`, `Timer`, `GlassWater`, `Utensils`, `Camera`, `Backpack` (last, so "race kit" never beats a line naming what is in it). The race flag and the bandana are not in lucide, so they are drawn here through lucide's own `createLucideIcon` and inherit its grid, stroke and props. |
| `bank-accounts.ts` | Validating and normalizing per-event bank accounts between form, API and wizard. |
| `phone.ts` + `request-country.ts` | Phone numbers stored in **E.164**. Country list from dial codes; names via `Intl.DisplayNames`. The country is *guessed* from `x-vercel-ip-country` and always overridable. `NATIONAL_DIGITS` carries the exact national length for the countries we are sure of (**PH = 10**) and is deliberately short: `maxNationalDigits` caps the field at it, `isPlausiblePhone` requires it, and everything unlisted stays loose under E.164's 15-digit ceiling. The trunk zero is stripped **before** the cap applies, or a pasted `09171234567` loses its last digit. |
| `blob.ts` | Every upload. `uploadPublicFile` (returns a URL) vs `uploadPrivateProof` (returns a **pathname**) + `signedProofUrl`. 4 MB cap, because a Vercel function body caps at 4.5 MB. |
| `auth.ts` / `jwt.ts` | bcrypt hashing, the `admin_token` httpOnly cookie (1 day), `getAuthCookie()` in server code. |
| `signed-in-user.ts` | The name and initial the admin sidebars show — read from the record, not the token, so a rename is never stale. |
| `site-contact.ts` | Site name, contact email, legal "last updated", social channels. **Site-wide details belong here**, destined to become superadmin-editable settings — never inline them in a component. |
| `email.ts` | Transactional email via Resend, sent from `CONTACT_EMAIL`. Two emails per registration, never one, and they differ in purpose, not just timing: `sendRegistrationReceivedEmail` fires the moment the row is created (`checkout` for online, `checkout/manual` for bank transfer) — before any payment is confirmed — and shows every field submitted (per-runner emergency contact, gender, birthdate, community, etc.) so a typo is caught before payment. `sendRegistrationConfirmationEmail` (the receipt) fires only once status reaches `PAID` — from the PayMongo webhook, or the admin status route once a bank transfer is verified — and stays focused on the money (compact runner list, full cost breakdown), since the received email already covered the data. No artificial delay sits between the two; the PayMongo webhook is itself asynchronous, so "received" always lands first. The HTML template mirrors the app's own look (the real site logo on a dark header, orange→blue gradient accent bar, a color-coded status pill — blue "pending" for received, green "success" for the receipt — instead of plain caption text). **The whole body is one table, and that is the layout strategy — do not split it back into separate tables per section.** Gmail's Android app renders every nested table shrink-to-fit: it sizes each to its own content and ignores the declared width, whether that width is a percentage, a pixel value, an HTML `width` attribute or `table-layout: fixed` (all four were tried; all four failed, as did wrapping each section in a bordered card). Separate tables therefore end up at *different* widths, so a block of short money values stops well short of the right edge while a block holding a long venue name reaches it. Rows of a single table cannot disagree that way — one set of columns means every value right-aligns to the same edge by construction — and the long paragraphs, sitting in that same table as full-width rows, are what push the shared width out to the container. `cardRow()` is the one sanctioned exception: it nests a bordered block inside a full-width row, and **only blocks whose values are long** (event title, venue, email, phone) may go in one, because those fill the width on their own content — which is why they always rendered correctly. Blocks of short values (the money summary, the compact runner list) must stay plain rows of the body table. **One recipient per send, and no bcc.** Resend meters its free tier by *recipient*, counting a bcc as one of them, so the archive copy this used to carry doubled the quota cost of every email and put a registration at four units against a ceiling of a hundred a day. Resend's own dashboard keeps the log that mailbox existed for. Subjects include the order reference so Gmail can't thread two emails together and hide one behind "Show trimmed content". Any layout change here is a mobile-first bug: verify in the Gmail app, since desktop looks fine either way. A send failure is logged and swallowed, never thrown, so a bounced email can't undo a payment. |

## 6. Routes

### Public
| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Home. Hero + up to 6 **upcoming** events, soonest first. Events are the point of this page. |
| `/events` | Full upcoming listing |
| `/events/[slug]` | Event detail and registration entry point (closed once the race is over) |
| `/events/[slug]/register` | The wizard — `RegistrationWizardClient` (ONLINE: 3 steps, plus step 4 for proof when the runner picks bank transfer) or `BankTransferWizardClient` (3 steps). Steps: **1** runners & categories, **2** logistics, **3** checkout/payment, **4** proof upload. |
| `/results` | Finished-event landing, most recent first — the same `EventGrid` card as `/events`, with `action="results"` |
| `/events/[slug]/results` | Winners board |
| `/events/[slug]/results/full` | Full searchable table; category filter via query param |
| `/events/[slug]/results/[resultId]` | One runner's result plus `ECertificateGenerator` (pdf-lib) |
| `/coming-soon`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `not-found` | Real designed pages — see the no-dead-links rule in §8 |

### Organizer (`/admin`, gated by `src/proxy.ts`)
`/admin` dashboard · `/admin/login` · `/admin/register` · `/admin/events` (plus
`/new` and `/[id]/edit`) · `/admin/events/[id]/registrants` ·
`/admin/events/[id]/results` (the uploader detects the sheet's real header row —
timing exports open with banner rows — and maps columns by sheet index, not by
label) · `/admin/marketing` (promo codes) ·
`/admin/settings` (profile + password) · `/admin/[...missing]` → the admin's own 404.

### Super admin (`/superadmin`)
`/superadmin` dashboard (platform revenue, fees) · `/superadmin/organizers`
(approve, suspend, set commission) · `/superadmin/communities` (approve, rename,
reject clubs) · `/superadmin/[...missing]`.

### API (`src/app/api/**/route.ts`)
| Route | Methods | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auth/login`, `auth/logout`, `auth/register` | POST | Sets / clears `admin_token` |
| `checkout` | POST | PayMongo checkout session. Re-derives every amount from the database. |
| `checkout/manual` | POST | Bank transfer: multipart, proof file → private blob |
| `webhooks/paymongo` | POST | HMAC-verified; marks the registration `PAID` |
| `upload` | POST | Organizer-only image upload (public store) |
| `admin/events`, `admin/events/[id]` | POST / GET, PUT, DELETE | Event CRUD including categories and bank accounts |
| `admin/events/[id]/results/upload` | POST | CSV/XLSX results import; dedupes by bib, computes seconds and the three ranks |
| `admin/registrations/[id]/status` | PATCH | Confirm or reject a manual payment |
| `admin/runners/[id]`, `admin/runners/bulk-delete` | PUT/DELETE, POST | Registrant editing |
| `admin/proof/[id]` | GET | Auth-checked redirect to a short-lived signed proof URL |
| `admin/promos` | POST | Promo codes |
| `admin/profile`, `admin/profile/password` | PATCH | Self-service only; the id comes from the cookie, never the body |
| `superadmin/organizers`, `superadmin/organizers/[id]` | GET, PATCH | Status and commission |
| `superadmin/communities`, `superadmin/communities/[id]` | GET/POST, PATCH/DELETE | Club curation |

---

## 7. Security model

- `src/proxy.ts` guards `/admin/**` (except `/login` and `/register`) and
  `/superadmin/**`: no token → `/admin/login`; a `SUPER_ADMIN` on `/admin` →
  `/superadmin`; a non-super-admin on `/superadmin` → `/admin`.
- **Route handlers re-check auth themselves.** The proxy does not cover
  `/api/**`, so every admin route calls `getAuthCookie()` and scopes its queries
  to the signed-in organizer.
- **Never trust client amounts.** `checkout` and `checkout/manual` refetch the
  event and recompute the delivery fee, platform fee, and subtotal (including the
  shirt upcharge) before writing or billing. Mismatches are rejected.
- **Server-side gates, not just UI ones.** Consent (`consentGiven !== true`) and
  the finished-race check (`hasFinished`) are enforced in the API, because a tab
  left open yesterday will still POST.
- Payment proofs are **private** blobs, served only through
  `/api/admin/proof/[id]` with a roughly five-minute signed URL.
- Passwords are bcrypt-hashed; the session cookie is httpOnly, `sameSite=lax`,
  `secure` in production, with a one-day expiry.

---

## 8. Standing rules for this project

These are the user's own standing preferences. Follow them without being asked.

1. **No dead links, ever.** A runner or organizer must never hit a placeholder
   `href="#"` or a bare 404. A destination that is not built yet gets a real,
   designed page — that is what `/coming-soon` and `StatusPanel` exist for.
2. **The UI must look expensive and uniform.** Browser and OS default controls
   (native `<select>`, `alert()`, `confirm()`) are unacceptable. A new control
   copies an existing one: `SelectField`, `Combobox`, `AlertProvider`'s
   `alert`/`confirm`, `AlertModal`, `StatusPanel`, `FieldError`.
3. **Consult the project's `ui-ux-pro-max` skill for UI/UX work** rather than
   designing ad hoc. Skills stay project-scoped in `.claude/skills/` — nothing is
   installed globally.
4. **Validation messages must be specific.** Name exactly what is missing and
   highlight the offending fields; never a generic catch-all. See
   `app/events/[slug]/register/validation.ts` and `FieldError`.
5. **The home page exists to showcase events.** Events stay the focal point.
6. **Table action icons align under their column header**, never pushed to the
   row's right edge.
7. **Site-wide contact and social details live in `lib/site-contact.ts`**, headed
   for superadmin-editable settings — never inline in a component.
8. **Work must reach the user's dev server.** They test on their own
   `localhost:3000` running the **main checkout**, so anything left in a git
   worktree is invisible to them. Edit in the main checkout — that alone is
   enough for them to see the change.
9. **Never commit or push until the user says so.** Finish the work, verify it,
   report it, and leave it uncommitted in the working tree. `git commit` and
   `git push` wait for their explicit command — say plainly that the change is
   sitting there unstaged rather than assuming a finished change should land.
10. **Weigh storage cost** (Neon's free 0.5 GB tier) before growing the schema.
11. **Comment the *why*.** This codebase's header comments explain the reasoning
    behind a decision, not what the code does. Match that voice.

---

## 9. Conventions

- **Server Components by default**; `'use client'` only where interaction needs
  it. Pages fetch with Prisma directly and client islands take props.
- Imports use the `@/` alias for `src/`.
- Registrant text is stored **UPPERCASE**, email excepted (§5, `text-case.ts`).
  A field whose value is stored uppercase shows an uppercase *sample*
  placeholder; a placeholder that is an instruction stays sentence case.
- Money is centavos everywhere (§5). Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings against a
  Manila "today". Phones are E.164.
- String columns instead of Postgres enums (`status`, `role`, `paymentMethod`,
  `logisticsMethod`, `deliveryZone`, `eventType`, `registrationForm`) — which is
  exactly why each has an `asX()` guard in `lib/` that the API must call on
  untrusted input. **Every one of them is stored UPPERCASE**, and the guards
  accept either casing so rows written before that rule still read correctly.
  PayMongo is the one consumer that needs lowercase, and
  `paymongoPaymentType()` is the only place that converts.
- **One public event card.** `components/EventGrid` renders every public event
  listing — `/`, `/events`, `/results` — so an event looks like itself wherever
  it appears. It differs only by its `action` prop (`'register'` → the event
  page, `'results'` → the winners board), a string rather than a callback
  because the pages rendering it are Server Components. Never fork a rival card.
- **One option row at sign-up.** `events/[slug]/register/CategoryPicker` renders
  a race's distances and a fun run's packages with the *same* full-width radio
  row — poster thumbnail, name, price on a shared right edge — because to the
  runner it is one decision either way. A race's distance is a chip beside the
  name; that chip is the only difference. Do not bring back a separate grid.
- Styling: Tailwind utilities plus the CSS variables in `globals.css` (motion,
  spacing, radius, glass, gradient tokens). The admin has `Admin.css` and
  `Auth.css`; the wizard and event page have their own CSS files. Dark,
  glassmorphic, with an orange (`#FF6B00`) → blue (`#007AFF`) gradient.
- Fonts: Outfit (`--font-sans`, headings), Inter (`--font-body`).
- Commit style: `feat:` / `fix:` / `refactor:` plus a sentence saying what changed
  for the user.

---

## 10. Current state

`FEATURES_CHECKLIST.md` tracks the roadmap; every major section is ticked through
the results and e-certificate module.

**`IMPROVEMENTS_PLAN.md` is the active work queue.** Fourteen agreed improvements
in seven batches, with the decisions behind each one already settled. The user
works it **one batch per session** to keep conversations short, so a session
picking it up should read the batch marked *Next*, do only that batch, mark it
Done, and stop. Delete the file once every batch is done.

Known open threads:

- Site contact and social links are constants awaiting a **superadmin settings
  screen**; the social icons currently point at `/coming-soon`.
- PayMongo runs in **test mode**.
- Registration emails send via **Resend** from
  `info@cresendorunningcommunity.com` (a Hostinger Titan mailbox; Resend only
  handles outbound sending, not the inbox) — a "received" email at submission
  plus a "receipt" email once PAID (see `email.ts`). No results-ready or
  reminder emails yet. The app stays on Resend's **free tier in production** —
  100 recipients a day, and it stops rather than bills — which is a decision,
  not an oversight. Dropping the bcc archive brought a registration back to two
  recipients, so the ceiling is roughly 50 registrations a day; making that
  ceiling visible rather than silent is Batch F of `IMPROVEMENTS_PLAN.md`.
- `src/data/mockEvents.ts` is legacy and is no longer the source for real pages.

## Keeping this file updated

**Whenever you add or change a feature, update this file in the same change.**
Specifically:

- A new or changed **model or column** → §4, and §5 if a new rule module came
  with it.
- A new **page or API route** → §6, and §7 if it changes who may reach what.
- A new **shared module in `src/lib`** → §5, described by the *rule* it owns, not
  just its name.
- A new **reusable UI primitive** → §8 or §9, so the next session copies it
  instead of inventing a rival.
- A **standing instruction from the user** → §8, phrased as a rule.
- Anything shipped or unblocked → §10.

Keep it a briefing: dense, current, and short enough to read in full at the start
of a session. If a detail is only true of one file, the explanation belongs in
that file's header comment and only its headline belongs here.
